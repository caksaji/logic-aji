/*
 Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list. [Kuya]

Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:

It must be greater than the original word
It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition
Example:
- abcd

The next largest word is abdc.

Complete the function biggerIsGreater below to create and return the new string meeting the criteria. If it is not possible, return no answer.

function biggerIsGreater() {
    // Write your code here
